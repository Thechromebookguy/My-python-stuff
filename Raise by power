# Raise one number by a power calculator by Richard Harding 27/11/2020

# Define power how x is raised by y to give answer

# In python the calculation is x**y i.e 2**3 = 8,not 2^3 = 8

def power (x, y):
    return x**y

# input the first number to be raised by a power

num1 = float(input("Enter first number:"))

# Input the second number the power to raise the first number

num2 = float(input("Enter second number:"))

# Do the python calculation of ** which raises a number to the power number.

# Print out the answer

print(num1 ** num2,('is ', num1, 'raised to the power of ', num2))
